Our project aims to develop a simulation where various types of agents interact to form an artificial stock market. 
Through our observations, we've noted that not only are the decision-making rules of each agent crucial, but also the sizes of their respective groups play a significant role. 
What's particularly intriguing is that even with the implementation of straightforward decision rules, 
such as observing moving averages or Bollinger Bands, we witness the emergence of highly intricate stock patterns within the simulation.
